          Tolu was no tech wizard—not yet. By day, he worked as a client agent at a bustling study abroad agency, helping
          hopeful students chase dreams across continents. He booked appointments, answered endless emails, and patiently
          walked anxious parents through visa procedures. He was good at it. But deep down, he craved something more—something
          he could build with his own hands, something that would outlast a phone call or a stamp on a passport.
        </p>
        <p>That craving brought him to the PLP Software Engineering course.</p>
        <p>
          Every evening, once the office lights dimmed and the buzz of student inquiries faded, Tolu transformed into a learner.
          He'd pull out his modest laptop, open up his lessons, and dive into a world that was still foreign to him—variables,
          loops, syntax errors, Git. At first, it felt like learning a new language with no translator. But there was fire in his belly.
        </p>
        <p>He wasn't just learning to code; he was laying the bricks for a future he could shape on his own terms.</p>
        <p>
          Tolu dreamed of one day building digital platforms that made education more accessible—perhaps even an app that streamlined
          study abroad processes for students in underrepresented communities.
        </p>
        <p>
          Balancing work with the PLP course wasn't easy. He'd return home exhausted, only to spend hours debugging a stubborn
          Python function. Sometimes he questioned himself. Was this really worth it?
        </p>
        <p>
          But then he'd remember the way his heart raced the first time he saw "Hello, World!" printed on his screen. The way each
          small win felt like a leap.
        </p>
        <p>He wasn't just chasing another job. Tolu was chasing impact.</p>
        <p>
          Though the journey was long, and the nights even longer, he knew this: his story had only just begun—between visa
          applications and variables, between clients and code.
        </p>
        <p>
          He wasn't just crossing borders anymore. He was building bridges. Building with the assurance that, in a little while, crossing
          to the other side would be assured.
